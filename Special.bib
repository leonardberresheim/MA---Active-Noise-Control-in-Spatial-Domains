abstract = {Active noise control systems offer a potential method of reducing the weight of passive acoustic treatment and, therefore, increasing vehicles' fuel efficiency. These can be particularly cost-efficient if integrated with the entertainment system. A combined system is presented employing feedforward control of engine noise and feedback control of road noise, using a 'modal' error signal. Due to the dependence of the feedback system on the modal response of the vehicle cabin, and the influence of structural-acoustic coupling on this response, the effects of structural-acoustic coupling upon the performance of the active noise control strategies is investigated. An elemental model of structural-acoustic coupling is derived and used to simulate the change in performance of the active control systems as a result of coupling; the feedforward component is largely unaffected by structural-acoustic coupling, whilst the modal feedback performance is reduced from 11 to 8 dB attenuation in total acoustic potential energy, due to the shift in the frequency of the targeted acoustic mode. The simulation results are confirmed through experiments conducted in a structural-acoustic coupled enclosure.},

abstract = {The use of linear filters to extract desired signals from sensed signals which contain a mixture of the desired and undesired signals inherently alters amplitude and phase characteristics of the desired signals. Attenuation and phaseshift incurred in the extracted desired signals is undesirable in applications such as real-time physiological tremor compensation. Algorithms based on Fourier linear combiners (FLC) such as a Weighted-frequency Fourier Linear Combiner (WFLC), and a Bandlimited Multiple Fourier Linear Combiner (BMFLC) can estimate and extract periodic signals without altering the amplitude and phase characteristics. The proper performance of the algorithms usually requires prefiltering of the sensed signals using linear filters. Moreover, in some situations, the sensed signals have been prefiltered by inevitable linear filters present in the sensors or sensor modules. Modification made to WFLC and BMFLC to compensate for the change in amplitude and phase characteristics of the extracted desired periodic signals due to the prefiltering for real-time applications is presented. A way to perform prediction of a periodic signal using the WFLC or BMFLC algorithm is also shown. {\textcopyright}2009 IEEE.},

abstract = {This paper provides a detailed derivation of a full vehicle model, which may be used to simulate the behaviour of a vehicle in longitudinal direction. The 14 degrees of freedom (14-DOF) vehicle model is integrated with an analytical tyre dynamics using Calspan tyre model. The full vehicle model was validated experimentally with an instrumented experimental vehicle based on the driver input from brake or throttle pedals. Several transient handling tests were performed, namely sudden acceleration and sudden braking test. Comparisons of the experimental result and model response with sudden braking and throttling imposed motion are made.The results of model validation show that the trends between simulation results and experimental data are almost similar with acceptable error. An adaptive PID control strategy was implemented on the validated full vehicle model to reduce unwanted vehicle motions in longitudinal direction during sudden braking and throttling manoeuvre. The results show that the proposed control structure is able to significantly improve the dynamic performance of the vehicle during sudden braking and sudden acceleration under various conditions.

abstract = {Active noise control systems offer a potential method of reducing the weight of passive acoustic treatment and, therefore, increasing vehicles' fuel efficiency. The widespread commercialisation of active noise control has, however, not been achieved partly due to the cost of implementation. To achieve cost-effective control of road noise, a feedback control strategy is presented which employs the array of microphones and the car audio loudspeakers common to a feedforward engine noise control system. The proposed system weights the contributions from the error microphones and the loudspeakers to increase the magnitude of the open-loop response over the bandwidth where noise attenuation is required, as in modal feedback control. This spatial filtering technique is combined with temporal filtering to further enhance the magnitude of the open-loop response over the targeted bandwidth and to compensate for the phase response of the control loudspeakers. The proposed feedback control system is shown to achieve reductions of up to 10 dB in the composite error signal, but only reduces the sum of the squared pressures by around 3 dB over a very narrow bandwidth.},

abstract = {An active noise control (ANC) system based on adaptive filter theory was developed in the 1980s; however, only with the recent introduction of powerful but inexpensive digital signal processor (DSP) hardware, such as the TMS320 family, has the technology become practical. The specialized DSPs were designed for real-time numerical processing of digitized signals. These devices have enabled the low-cost implementation of powerful adaptive ANC algorithms and encouraged the widespread development of ANC systems. ANC that uses adaptive signal processing implemented on a low-cost, high-performance DSP is an emerging new technology. This application report presents general background information about ANC methods. Contrasts between passive and active noise control are described, and the circumstances under which ANC is preferable are shown. Different types of noise-control algorithms are discussed: feedforward broadband, feedforward narrowband, and feedback algorithms. The report details the design of a simple ANC system using a TMS320 DSP and the implementation of that design.},

abstract = {The low-frequency broadband noise generated by an air-conditioning unit on a railway vehicle may be significant in situations where the vehicle is stopped or its speed is low. Low-frequency acoustic radiation is extremely difficult to attenuate using passive means, so in this work, active noise control (ANC) techniques were applied. Laboratory experiments were performed in which noise from two different sources, namely from loudspeakers and an axial fan, was introduced into a real air-conditioning duct, identical to that installed on a subway vehicle. The control approach used a doubled, single-input, single-output (SISO), feedforward, filtered-X LMS algorithm. Control algorithms were designed using the Matlab-Simulink program and the Real Time Windows Target toolbox of Matlab in order to run the ANC in real time. Attenuations of 15-20 dB at the error microphone locations were achieved when loudspeakers were used as primary noise generators. However, noise reduction was quite poor when noise was introduced via the axial fan. This was due to turbulence generated by the airflow, which has a negative influence on the performance of the control system. {\textcopyright} 2003 Institute of Noise Control Engineering.},

abstract = {Attention mechanisms play a central role in NLP systems, especially within recurrent neural network (RNN) models. Recently, there has been increasing interest in whether or not the intermediate representations offered by these modules may be used to explain the reasoning for a model's prediction, and consequently reach insights regarding the model's decision-making process. A recent paper claims that 'Attention is not Explanation' (Jain and Wallace, 2019). We challenge many of the assumptions underlying this work, arguing that such a claim depends on one's definition of explanation, and that testing it needs to take into account all elements of the model. We propose four alternative tests to determine when/whether attention can be used as explanation: a simple uniform-weights baseline; a variance calibration based on multiple random seed runs; a diagnostic framework using frozen weights from pretrained models; and an end-to-end adversarial attention training protocol. Each allows for meaningful interpretation of attention mechanisms in RNN models. We show that even when reliable adversarial distributions can be found, they don't perform well on the simple diagnostic, indicating that prior work does not disprove the usefulness of attention mechanisms for explainability.},

The commercialisation of active noise control has not been widespread, however, partly due to the cost of implementation. This paper investigates the design and performance of feedback road noise control systems, which could be implemented cost-effectively by using the car audio loudspeakers as control sources and low-cost microphones as error sensors. Three feedback control systems are investigated, of increasing complexity: a single-input single-output (SISO) controller; a SISO controller employing weighted arrays of error sensors and control sources; and a fully-coupled multi-input multi-output (MIMO) controller. For each of the three controllers robustness and disturbance enhancement constraints are defined, and by formulating the three controllers, using an Internal Model Control (IMC) architecture and using frequency discretisation, the constrained optimization problems are solvable using sequential quadratic programming. The performance of the three controllers and the associated design methods are first evaluated in a simulated environment, which allows the physical limits on performance to be understood. Finally, to validate the results in the simulated environment, the performance of the three controllers has been calculated using data measured in a car cabin, and it has been shown that the fully-coupled MIMO controller is able to achieve significant low frequency road noise control, at the expense of increased implementation complexity compared to the SISO and SISO weighted transducer arrays feedback controllers.},

abstract = {Shutting the window is usually the last resort in mitigating environmental noise, at the expense of natural ventilation. We describe an active sound control system fitted onto the opening of the domestic window that attenuates the incident sound, achieving a global reduction in the room interior while maintaining natural ventilation. The incident sound is actively attenuated by an array of control modules (a small loudspeaker) distributed optimally across the aperture. A single reference microphone provides advance information for the controller to compute the anti-noise signal input to the loudspeakers in real-time. A numerical analysis revealed that the maximum active attenuation potential outperforms the perfect acoustic insulation provided by a fully shut single-glazed window in ideal conditions. To determine the real-world performance of such an active control system, an experimental system is realized in the aperture of a full-sized window installed on a mockup room. Up to 10-dB reduction in energy-averaged sound pressure level was achieved by the active control system in the presence of a recorded real-world broadband noise. However, attenuation in the low-frequency range and its maximum power output is limited by the size of the loudspeakers.},

abstract = {The noise inside a truck cabin is caused by various sources such as the engine, transmission, wheel vibrations, wind, and some other external sources. In general, the interior noise of vehicles is composed of two components: one is synchronized with the engine rotation or other periodic noise, while the other is caused by stochastic sources [1]. For most midsized trucks with an in-line four-cylinder engine, periodic noise is the dominant part of the internal noise. Such periodic noise is a combination of the harmonic noise components, also known as noise orders. Furthermore, the order frequency range is relatively low, typically below 500 Hz. That makes Active Noise Control (ANC) effective in attenuating the order-related noise. The most commonly used strategy is narrowband feedforward ANC with a Filtered-x Least Mean Squares (FXLMS) algorithm [1]. The FXLMS algorithm, first derived by Widrow in 1981, has been used successfully for many applications, such as broadband noise in an enclosure [2], single frequency noise in a duct [3], multiple frequency noise in a helicopter [4], and time-varying noise in a tractor [5]. As the speed of truck engine changes, the order frequencies change continuously during operation. That compromises the overall performance of the ANC system because the FXLMS approach exhibits the frequency-dependent convergence behavior. Although several variations to the FXLMS algorithm have been developed in an effort to overcome the performance degradation, their drawback is that they either increase the computational burden of the algorithm or add the algorithm's complexity. Recently, a new approach known as the Eigenvalue Equalization Filtered-x Least Mean Squares (EE-FXLMS) algorithm has been developed by Thomas et al. [6], and already been proven effective to overcome the frequency dependent performance, and to improve the overall performance in the desired frequency range [6], [7], [8]. More importantly, the implementation of the equalized algorithm is straightforward and only minor modifications are needed to the existing FXLMS algorithms. In this paper, a narrowband feedforward ANC system for a truck cabin is presented. A normal FXLMS algorithm and an equalized FXLMS algorithm based on the former case are implemented, and the performance of the approaches is compared experimentally. 2 THE ACTIVE NOISE CONTROL SYSTEM Based on a real truck cabin provided by Dongfeng Motor Company (DFL) from China, the recordings of the noise data at all relevant driving speeds are measured and analyzed [9]. According to the results, at each gear, the most dominant periodic component throughout the range is the 2nd order, the firing frequency of the engine. There are also other two orders which are clearly detectable orders in the spectra, the 4th and the 6th orders. As suggested [8], the orders 2, 4 and 6 are attenuated consequently as much as possible in the practical ANC},

abstract = {Minimization of interior cabin noise has been a key topic of research in the automobile industry for the last two decades. This problem was initially approached via passive noise cancelation methods, where physical treatments such as structural damping and acoustic absorption were used. However, with vehicle manufacturers striving for more economical and lightweight designs, the resulting car interiors invariably became noisier due to the increased structural vibrations. These noise fields are generally dominanted by low frequencies (i.e., 0-500 Hz) [1], [2], hence, the conventional passive noise cancelation approaches are less effective. In an attempt to resolve the aforementioned problem, active noise control (ANC) methods were developed where secondary sources were proposed to attenuate the noise inside the cabin. With modern in-car entertainment systems providing four to six built-in loudspeakers, the addition of an ANC system comes at a relatively low additional cost.},

abstract = {Helicopter aircrews are exposed to high levels of vibration and noise during flight. This paper presents the investigation of adaptive seat mount approaches to reduce vibration on the helicopter seat. A flight test on a helicopter with typical pilot configurations showed that the vibration spectra on the pilot's helmet not only included the dominant N/rev harmonic peaks of the rotor speed, but also consisted of a low frequency resonant peak in the frequency range of human abdominal and spine resonant frequencies. Long-term exposure to this vibration may lead to occupational health issues such as damage to pilot spine and neck. In order to address this issue, a novel adaptive seat mount concept was developed to mitigate the vibration levels transmitted to the aircrew. As a proof-of-concept demonstration, a miniature modal shaker was installed between the cabin floor and the seat bottom as the adaptive mount that provided the actuation authority. The objective was to reduce the vertical vibration transmitted to the aircrew helmet in order to decrease aircrew neck and spine injuries cause by the transmitted vibration. Extensive closed-loop control test have been conducted on a full-scale helicopter seat with a mannequin with varying physical properties. A 10,000lb(f) mechanical shaker was used to provide representative helicopter vibration profiles to the seat. Significant vibration reductions on the N/rev vibration peaks were achieved, and the low frequency resonant peak was also suppressed simultaneously.},

abstract = {Background noise in wind tunnel environments poses a challenge to acoustic measurements due to possible low or negative Signal to Noise Ratios (SNRs) present in the testing environment. This paper overviews the application of time domain Adaptive Noise Cancellation (ANC) to microphone array signals with an intended application of background noise reduction in wind tunnels. An experiment was conducted to simulate background noise from a wind tunnel circuit measured by an out-of-flow microphone array in the tunnel test section. A reference microphone was used to acquire a background noise signal which interfered with the desired primary noise source signal at the array. The technique's efficacy was investigated using frequency spectra from the array microphones, array beamforming of the point source region, and subsequent deconvolution using the Deconvolution Approach for the Mapping of Acoustic Sources (DAMAS) algorithm. Comparisons were made with the conventional techniques for improving SNR of spectral and Cross-Spectral Matrix subtraction. The method was seen to recover the primary signal level in SNRs as low as -29 dB and outperform the conventional methods. A second processing approach using the center array microphone as the noise reference was investigated for more general applicability of the ANC technique. It outperformed the conventional methods at the -29 dB SNR but yielded less accurate results when coherence over the array dropped. This approach could possibly improve conventional testing methodology but must be investigated further under more realistic testing conditions. {\textcopyright} 2011 by the American Institute of Aeronautics and Astronautics, Inc.
