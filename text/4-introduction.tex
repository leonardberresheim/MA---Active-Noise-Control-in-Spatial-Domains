\section{Collection of citations}
The traditional approach to acoustic noise control uses passive techniques such as enclosures, barriers, and silencers to attenuate the undesired noise [1], [2]. These passive silencers are valued for their high attenuation over a broad frequency range; however, they are relatively large, costly, and ineffective at low frequencies\cite{}
