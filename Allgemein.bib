abstract = {This Project involves the study of the principles of Adaptive Noise Cancellation (ANC) and its Applications. Adaptive oise Cancellation is an alternative technique of estimating signals corrupted by additive noise or interference. Its advantage lies in that, with no apriori estimates of signal or noise, levels of noise rejection are attainable that would be difficult or impossible to achieve by other signal processing methods of removing noise. Its cost, inevitably, is that it needs two inputs - a primary input containing the corrupted signal and a reference input containing noise correlated in some unknown way with the primary noise. The reference input is adaptively filtered and subtracted from the primary input to obtain the signal estimate. Adaptive filtering before subtraction allows the treatment of inputs that are deterministic or stochastic, stationary or time-variable.},

abstract = {This paper describes the concept of adaptive noise cancel- ling, an alternative method of estimating signals corrupted by additive noise or interference. The method uses a “primary” input containing the corrupted signal and a “reference” input containing noise correlated in some unknown way with the primary noise. The reference input is adaptively filtered and subtracted from the primary input to obtain the signal estimate. Adaptive filtering before subtraction allows the treatment of inputs that are deterministic or stochastic, stationary or time variable. Wiener solutions are developed to describe asymptotic adaptive performance and output signal-to-noise ratio for stationary stochastic inputs, including single and multiple reference inputs.

@article{DeDIego2000,
abstract = {In this paper, a novel adaptive algorithm for equalization of periodic signals using active control is developed. This algorithm actively cancels out a single frequency without changing the amplitude levels at close frequencies. The algorithm performance is compared with that of an adaptive equalizer previously reported (Kuo and Ji 1995 and Kuo and Morgan 1996). Both algorithms are used for a real multichannel system in order to equalize some given frequencies of a primary signal. The local active noise control system has been used to create an equalization zone. A two channel system is used and the total pressure is controlled at two microphones. A 4100 type Bruel manikin with two calibrated microphones at the ear canals has been used to obtain sound levels in a hypothetic listener's ears. The equalization points are not only the error sensors positions but an area around them which is measured using the manikin.},

@article{Shen2018,
abstract = {Active Noise Cancellation (ANC) is a classical area where noise in the environment is canceled by producing anti-noise signals near the human ears (e.g., in Bose's noise cancellation headphones). This paper brings IoT to active noise cancellation by combining wireless communication with acoustics. The core idea is to place an IoT device in the environment that listens to ambient sounds and forwards the sound over its wireless radio. Since wireless signals travel much faster than sound, our ear-device receives the sound in advance of its actual arrival. This serves as a glimpse into the future, that we call lookahead, and proves crucial for real-time noise cancellation, especially for unpredictable, wide-band sounds like music and speech. Using custom IoT hardware, as well as lookahead-aware cancellation algorithms, we demonstrate MUTE, a fully functional noise cancellation prototype that outperforms Bose's latest ANC headphone. Importantly, our design does not need to block the ear - the ear canal remains open, making it comfortable (and healthier) for continuous use.},

@article{Zhang2019,
abstract = {In this paper, we investigate the maximum active noise control performance over a three-dimensional (3-D) spatial space, for a given set of secondary sources in a particular environment. We first formulate the spatial active noise control (ANC) problem in a 3-D room. Then we discuss a wave-domain least squares method by matching the secondary noise field to the primary noise field in the wave domain. Furthermore, we extract the subspace from wave-domain coefficients of the secondary paths and propose a subspace method by matching the secondary noise field to the projection of primary noise field in the subspace. Simulation results demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed algorithms by comparison between the wave-domain least squares method and the subspace method, more specifically the energy of the loudspeaker driving signals, noise reduction inside the region, and residual noise field outside the region. We also investigate the ANC performance under different loudspeaker configurations and noise source positions.},

@article{Wu2004,
abstract = {This paper presents a multi-channel active noise control algorithm that is designed to reject periodic signals of unknown frequency. It is based on a so-called indirect approach, where the frequency of the disturbance is estimated in real time, and the estimate is used in a disturbance rejection scheme designed for a known frequency. Improvements over an earlier algorithm include an extension to multi-channel systems, a better frequency estimation algorithm, and a thorough experimental evaluation. For disturbance rejection, a so-called inverse G algorithm is proposed and its properties are compared through analysis and experiments to those of a gradient algorithm. A new frequency estimator is also considered that is simple and flexible in design, and is able to use multiple harmonics or multiple signals in order to estimate the fundamental frequency of the noise source. In this manner, the algorithm maintains tracking of the fundamental frequency despite significant changes in signal characteristics. The ability of the indirect approach to reject periodic noise with fixed or time-varying frequency and amplitudes is demonstrated in active noise control experiments. The algorithm may also be useful in other control applications where periodic disturbances of unknown frequency must be rejected. {\textcopyright} 2003 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

@article{Laugesen1993,
abstract = {In this study an algorithm for multichannel adaptive IIR filtering is presented and applied to the active control of broadband random noise in a small reverberant room. Assuming complete knowledge of the primary noise, the theoretically optimal reductions of acoustic energy are initially calculated by means of a frequency-domain modal model. These results are contrasted with results of a causality constrained theoretical time-domain optimization, which are then compared with experimental results, the latter two results showing good agreement. The experimental performance of adaptive multichannel FIR and IIR filters are then compared for a 4-secondary source, 8-error microphone active control system, indicating that for the present application FIR filters are sufficient when the primary noise source is a loudspeaker. Some experiments are then presented with the primary noise field generated by a panel excited by a loudspeaker in an adjoining room. These results show that far better performances are provided by UR than FIR filters when the primary source has a lightly damped dynamic behavior which the active controller must model. {\textcopyright} 1993 IEEE},

abstract = {This paper presents an integrated approach in designing a noise reduction headset for the audio and communication applications. Conventional passive headsets give good attenuation of ambient noise in the upper frequency range, while most of these devices fail below 500 Hz. Unlike the feedforward method, the adaptive feedback active noise control technique provides a more accurate noise cancellation since the microphone is placed inside the ear-cup of the headset. Furthermore, the system uses single microphone per ear cup, thus produces a more compact, lower power consumption, cheaper solution, and ease of integration with existing audio and communication devices to form an integrated feedback active noise control headsets. Simulation results have been conducted to show that the integrated approach can remove the disturbing noise and at the same time, allow the desired speech or audio signal to pass through without cancellation.},
