\section{Simulating an acoustic source in 3D - space}
\subsection{The Image Model}
The image model is a method that allows the computation of a source-to-receive acoustic transfer function in an enclosed 3D-space. Within this method an acoustic wave produces by a source, when crossing a wall, produces an image which then it self is considered as a source for further computation.\cite{Allen1979}

The equation of the emitted pressure wave for a single frequency point source of acceleration in free space is given by:
\begin{equation}
    P(\omega ,X,X') = \frac{e^{i\omega\frac{R}{c-t}}}{4\pi R},
\end{equation}
where\\
$P=$ pressure,\\
$\omega= 2\pi f$,\\
$f=$ frequency,\\
$t=$ time,\\
$R= |X-X'|$,\\
$X=$ vector talker location $(x,y,z)$,\\
$X'=$ vector microphone location ($x',y',z'$),\\
$i=\sqrt{-1}$,\\
$c=$ speed of sound.
\\

When a rigid wall (lossless) is present an image source is introduced into the equation:
\begin{equation}
    P(\omega ,X,X') = [\frac{e^{i\omega\frac{R_+}{c-t}}}{4\pi R_+} + \frac{e^{i\omega\frac{R_-}{c-t}}}{4\pi R_-}]e^{-i\omega t},
\end{equation}
where\\
$R_+=$ the source,\\
$R_-=$ the image.\\
If the wall is placed at $x=0$ the resulting distance from microphone to source and microphone to image is given by:
\begin{equation}
\begin{gathered}
     R_-^2 = (x-x')^2+(y-y')^2+(z-z')^2,\\
    R_+^2 = (x+x')^2+(y-y')^2+(z-z')^2
\end{gathered}
\end{equation}
With growing number of walls scene becomes more intricate as each image itself is imaged.\cite{Allen1979}
