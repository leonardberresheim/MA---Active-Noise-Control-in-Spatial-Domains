\chapter{Implementation}

As noted before the ANC system has solely been implemented in the simulation environment Matlab. The system consist of several subsystems. These subsystems will be elaborated step step and their functioning will be demonstrated.\\
The complete source code can be found in the \color{blue}\href{https://github.com/leonardberresheim/MA---Active-Noise-Control-in-Spatial-Domains/tree/main/Matlab}{projects github repository} \color{black} and is free to use, change and share without restrictions.

\section{Active Noise Control Setup}
\section{Spherical Harmonics Decomposition}
The accuracy of the spherical harmonics decomposition in (\ref{eq:primary_noise_field}) with it's truncation degree will be demonstrated using a plane wave as the exact harmonic coefficients can be calculated using (\ref{eq:plane_wave_coefficients})
