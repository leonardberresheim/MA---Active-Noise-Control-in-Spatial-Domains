\section{Image Source Method}
The implementation of the image source model will unfold in several steps. Building up from a rudimentary to a more complex and realistic implementation.
\subsection{Images Source Model with 4 walls - image order 1}
We start by modeling a simple room with only 4 walls (no ceiling or floor) with a single source positioned at the point $P(1,1,1)$ and its reflection of the first order relative to the wall as seen in the figure below.
