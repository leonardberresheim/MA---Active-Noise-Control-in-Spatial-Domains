\chapter{\centering Abstract}

With the continuing urbanization of modern life, spaces of quiet have become exceedingly rare. Highways have taken over the country side, the cities are overloaded with cars, the sky is pervaded by planes and the oceans have succumbed to cruise ships and freighters. And these vehicles on which we have made ourselves dependant are not subtle in their making of commotion.
Alas the only solution our contemporary human society has to offer to solve problems caused by technology is even more technology. This is where active noise control comes into play, allowing us to create secluded spaces of silence in a world of rumble.
