abstract = {In this paper, we investigate the maximum active noise control performance over a three-dimensional (3-D) spatial space, for a given set of secondary sources in a particular environment. We first formulate the spatial active noise control (ANC) problem in a 3-D room. Then we discuss a wave-domain least squares method by matching the secondary noise field to the primary noise field in the wave domain. Furthermore, we extract the subspace from wave-domain coefficients of the secondary paths and propose a subspace method by matching the secondary noise field to the projection of primary noise field in the subspace. Simulation results demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed algorithms by comparison between the wave-domain least squares method and the subspace method, more specifically the energy of the loudspeaker driving signals, noise reduction inside the region, and residual noise field outside the region. We also investigate the ANC performance under different loudspeaker configurations and noise source positions.},

@article{Samarasinghe2018,
abstract = {Allen and Berkley's image source method (ISM) is proven to be a very useful and popular technique for simulating the acoustic room transfer function (RTF) in reverberant rooms. It is based on the assumption that the source and receiver of interest are both omnidirectional. With the inherent directional nature of practical loudspeakers and the increasing use of directional microphones, the above assumption is often invalid. The main objective of this paper is to generalize the frequency domain ISM in the spherical harmonics domain such that it could simulate the RTF between practical transducers with higher-order directivity. This is achieved by decomposing transducer directivity patterns in terms of spherical harmonics and by applying the concept of image sources in spherical harmonics based propagation patterns. Therefore, from now on, any transducer can be modeled in the spherical harmonics domain with a realistic directivity pattern and incorporated with the proposed method to simulate room acoustics m...},

@article{Allen1979,
abstract = {Image methods are commonly used for the analysis of the acoustic properties of enclosures. In this paper we discuss the theoretical and practical use of image techniques for simulating, on a digital computer, the impulse response between two points in a small rectangular room. The resulting impulse response, when convolved with any desired input signal, such as speech, simulates room reverberation of the input signal. This technique is useful in signal processing or psychoacoustic studies. The entire process is carried out on a digital computer so that a wide range of room parameters can be studied with accurate control over the experimental conditions. A fortran implementation of this model has been included. {\textcopyright} 1979, Acoustical Society of America. All rights reserved.},
