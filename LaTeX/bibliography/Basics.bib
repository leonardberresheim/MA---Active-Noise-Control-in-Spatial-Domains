abstract = {The extension of Kalman filtering to the case of unknown variances is known as adaptive filtering. Duncan and Horn's (1972) representation of the Kalman time-series model is exploited to derive variance-component estimates from the standpoint of regression analysis. Specifically, the MINQUE of Rao (1970) and the AUE of Horn, Horn, and Duncan (1975) are applied. These estimates are then used to formulate adaptive filters. The adaptive filters are applied to simulated data, and their performance is compared to the method of Carew and Belanger (1973). {\textcopyright} 1984 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.},

@article{Thakkar2017,
abstract = {A revolution in science of electronics and communication has emerged in the last few decades, with the potential to create a paradigm shift in thinking about adaptive filtering. This Project involves the study of the principles of Adaptive Noise Cancellation (ANC) and its Applications. Adaptive noise Cancellation is an alternative technique of estimating signals corrupted by additive noise or interference. Its advantage lies in that, with no apriori estimates of signal or noise, levels of noise rejection are attainable that would be difficult or impossible to achieve by other signal processing methods of removing noise. Adaptive noise cancellation is an approach used for noise reduction in speech signal. As received signal is continuously corrupted by noise where both received signal and noise signal both changes continuously, then this arise the need of adaptive filtering. This paper deals with cancellation of noise on speech signal using an adaptive algorithm called least mean square (LMS) algorithm},

@article{Samarasinghe2018,
abstract = {Allen and Berkley's image source method (ISM) is proven to be a very useful and popular technique for simulating the acoustic room transfer function (RTF) in reverberant rooms. It is based on the assumption that the source and receiver of interest are both omnidirectional. With the inherent directional nature of practical loudspeakers and the increasing use of directional microphones, the above assumption is often invalid. The main objective of this paper is to generalize the frequency domain ISM in the spherical harmonics domain such that it could simulate the RTF between practical transducers with higher-order directivity. This is achieved by decomposing transducer directivity patterns in terms of spherical harmonics and by applying the concept of image sources in spherical harmonics based propagation patterns. Therefore, from now on, any transducer can be modeled in the spherical harmonics domain with a realistic directivity pattern and incorporated with the proposed method to simulate room acoustics m...},

@article{Zhang2019,
abstract = {In this paper, we investigate the maximum active noise control performance over a three-dimensional (3-D) spatial space, for a given set of secondary sources in a particular environment. We first formulate the spatial active noise control (ANC) problem in a 3-D room. Then we discuss a wave-domain least squares method by matching the secondary noise field to the primary noise field in the wave domain. Furthermore, we extract the subspace from wave-domain coefficients of the secondary paths and propose a subspace method by matching the secondary noise field to the projection of primary noise field in the subspace. Simulation results demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed algorithms by comparison between the wave-domain least squares method and the subspace method, more specifically the energy of the loudspeaker driving signals, noise reduction inside the region, and residual noise field outside the region. We also investigate the ANC performance under different loudspeaker configurations and noise source positions.},

@article{Acoustic,
abstract = {Acoustic waves constitute one kind of pressure fluctuation that can exist in a compressible fluido In addition to the audible pressure fields of modera te intensity, the most familiar, there are also ultrasonic and infrasonic waves whose frequencies lie beyond the limits of hearing, high-intensity waves (such as those near jet engines and missiles) that may produce a sensation of pain rather than sound, nonlinear waves of still higher intensities, and shock waves generated by explosions and supersonic aircraft. lnviscid fluids exhibit fewer constraints to deformations than do solids. The restoring forces responsible for propagating a wave are the pressure changes that oc-cur when the fluid is compressed or expanded. Individual elements of the fluid move back and forth in the direction of the forces, producing adjacent regions of com-pression and rarefaction similar to those produced by longitudinal waves in a bar.

@article{Allen1979,
abstract = {Image methods are commonly used for the analysis of the acoustic properties of enclosures. In this paper we discuss the theoretical and practical use of image techniques for simulating, on a digital computer, the impulse response between two points in a small rectangular room. The resulting impulse response, when convolved with any desired input signal, such as speech, simulates room reverberation of the input signal. This technique is useful in signal processing or psychoacoustic studies. The entire process is carried out on a digital computer so that a wide range of room parameters can be studied with accurate control over the experimental conditions. A fortran implementation of this model has been included. {\textcopyright} 1979, Acoustical Society of America. All rights reserved.},
