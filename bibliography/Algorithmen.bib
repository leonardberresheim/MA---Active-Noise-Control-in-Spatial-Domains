abstract = {The design of an optimal internal model-based (IMB) controller by extending standard discrete time optimal control theory for IMB controllers is described. The optimal observer and state feedback gains of the IMB controller are given via the solution of discrete time algebraic Riccati equations. The design method is applied to an acoustic system that is subjected to disturbances from a server fan. Periodic disturbances from the server fan appear as harmonics of the fundamental frequency of the fan. Parametric models for the plant and non-periodic part of the disturbance are identified from experimental data. An internal model is designed in discrete time and the internal model principle is used to design a feedback controller that rejects periodic disturbances in the acoustic system. The controller is implemented in real-time and successfully attenuates the first four harmonics of the fan noise. {\textcopyright} 2007 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

abstract = {The extension of Kalman filtering to the case of unknown variances is known as adaptive filtering. Duncan and Horn's (1972) representation of the Kalman time-series model is exploited to derive variance-component estimates from the standpoint of regression analysis. Specifically, the MINQUE of Rao (1970) and the AUE of Horn, Horn, and Duncan (1975) are applied. These estimates are then used to formulate adaptive filters. The adaptive filters are applied to simulated data, and their performance is compared to the method of Carew and Belanger (1973). {\textcopyright} 1984 Taylor {\&} Francis Group, LLC.},

abstract = {This letter proposes an adaptive filtering with averaging-based algorithm for active noise control (ANC) systems. This algorithm uses a similar structure as that of the FxLMS-based ANC system. The proposed algorithm, called Filtered-x Adaptive Filtering with Averaging (FxAFA) algorithm, uses averages of both data and correction terms to find the updated values of the tap weights of the ANC controller. The computer simulations are conducted for single-channel feedforward ANC systems. It is shown that the proposed algorithm gives fast convergence as compared with the FxLMS algorithm and achieves better performance in the presence of the measurement noise. The comparison with the FxRLS algorithm shows that the proposed FxAFA algorithm is a better choice for low computational complexity and stable performance.},

The basic approaches to active noise control are briefly reviewed. Primary emphasis is on a system identification approach to the problem using adaptive digital signal processing. A solution to problems caused by the acoustical nature of the application is presented. This includes a discussion of the use of an IIR (infinite-impulse response) adaptive filter to model the primary plant and compensate for acoustic feedback, the use of an independent random noise generator to continuously model the characteristics of the source and error plant, and the effect of uncorrelated noise on both processes.},

@article{Elliott1987,
abstract = {An algorithm is presented to adapt the coefficients of an array of FIR filters, whose outputs are linearly coupled to another array of error detection points, so that the sum of all the mean square error signals is minimized. The algorithm uses the instantaneous gradient of the total error, and for a single filter and error reduces to the “filtered x LMS” algorithm. The application of this algorithm to active sound and vibration control is discussed, by which suitably driven secondary sources are used to reduce the levels of acoustic or vibrational fields by minimizing the sum of the squares of a number of error sensor signals. A practical implementation of the algorithm is presented for the active control of sound at a single frequency. The algorithm converges on a timescale comparable to the response time of the system to be controlled, and is found to be very robust. If the pure tone reference signal is synchronously sampled, it is found that the behavior of the adaptive system can be completely described by a matrix of linear, time invariant, transfer functions. This is used to explain the behavior observed in simulations of a simplified single input, single output adaptive system, which retains many of the properties of the multichannel algorithm.

abstract = {The Modified FX-LMS (MFX-LMS) algorithm has been the subject of some research. It effectively removes the delay from the adaptation mechanism allowing faster convergence rates than the FX-LMS. It also allows the use of more sophisticated algorithms such as the RLS or the Kalman. Although this is true for perfect secondary path modeling, there is no extensive study of the influence of secondary path modeling errors in this algorithm. This paper tries to do just that. It shows that it's maximum allowed step-size is in fact almost independent of the delay in the secondary path, even in the presence of modeling errors. It also shows that for very large delays the algorithm is stable for phase errors of ±60° and for an estimated amplitude of more than half of the correct one.},

abstract = {An adaptive leaky normalized least-mean-square (NLMS) algorithm has been developed to optimize stability and performance of active noise cancellation systems. The research addresses LMS filter performance issues related to insufficient excitation, nonstationary noise fields, and time-varying signal-to-noise ratio. The adaptive leaky NLMS algorithm is based on a Lyapunov tuning approach in which three candidate algorithms, each of which is a function of the instantaneous measured reference input, measurement noise variance, and filter length, are shown to provide varying degrees of tradeoff between stability and noise reduction performance. Each algorithm is evaluated experimentally for reduction of low frequency noise in communication headsets, and stability and noise reduction performance are compared with that of traditional NLMS and fixed-leakage NLMS algorithms. Acoustic measurements are made in a specially designed acoustic test cell which is based on the original work of Ryan et al. ["Enclosure for low frequency assessment of active noise reducing circumaural headsets and hearing protection," Can. Acoust. 21, 19-20 (1993)] and which provides a highly controlled and uniform acoustic environment. The stability and performance of the active noise reduction system, including a prototype communication headset, are investigated for a variety of noise sources ranging from stationary tonal noise to highly nonstationary measured F-16 aircraft noise over a 20 dB dynamic range. Results demonstrate significant improvements in stability of Lyapunov-tuned LMS algorithms over traditional leaky or nonleaky normalized algorithms, while providing noise reduction performance equivalent to that of the NLMS algorithm for idealized noise fields.},

We show that our estimation based approach easily extends to the multi-channel case, and that it maintains all of the stability and performance features of the single-channel solution. The problem of noise calculation in a one dimensional acoustic duct, and a structural vibration control problem are chosen to examine the main characteristics of the proposed multi-channel adaptive algorithm. The performance of the new multi-channel adaptive algorithm is compared to the performance of a multi-channel implementation of the FxLMS algorithm in these cases, and it is shown that the new algorithm provides a faster response, with improved transient behavior and steady-state performance. {\textcopyright} 2000 AACC.},

The simulation of the noise cancellation using LMS adaptive filter algorithm is developed. The noise corrupted speech signal and the engine noise signal are used as inputs for LMS adaptive filter algorithm. The filtered signal is compared to the original noise-free speech signal in order to highlight the level of attenuation of the noise signal. The result shows that the noise signal is successfully canceled by the developed adaptive filter. The difference of the noise-free speech signal and filtered signal are calculated and the outcome implies that the filtered signal is approaching the noise-free speech signal upon the adaptive filtering. The frequency range of the successfully canceled noise by the LMS adaptive filter algorithm is determined by performing Fast Fourier Transform (FFT) on the signals. The LMS adaptive filter algorithm shows significant noise cancellation at lower frequency range.},

abstract = {Several adaptive filter structures are proposed for noise cancellation and arrhythmia detection. The adaptive filter essentially minimizes the mean-squared error between a primary input, which is the noisy ECG, and a reference input, which is either noise that is correlated in some way with the noise in the primary input or a signal that is correlated only with ECG in the primary input. Different filter structures are presented to eliminate the diverse forms of noise: baseline wander, 60 Hz power line interference, muscle noise, and motion artifact. An adaptive recurrent filter structure is proposed for acquiring the impulse response of the normal QRS complex. The primary input of the filter is the ECG signal to be analyzed, while the reference input is an impulse train coincident with the QRS complexes. This method is applied to several arrhythmia detection problems: detection of P-waves, premature ventricular complexes, and recognition of conduction block, atrial fibrillation, and paced rhythm.
