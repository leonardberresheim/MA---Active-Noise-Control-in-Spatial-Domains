abstract = {{\textcopyright} 2014 Acoustical Society of America. The acoustic performance of passive or active panel structures is usually tested in sound transmission loss facilities. A reverberant sending room, equipped with one or a number of independent sound sources, is used to generate a diffuse sound field excitation which acts as a disturbance source on the structure under investigation. The spatial correlation and coherence of such a synthesized non-ideal diffuse-sound-field excitation, however, might deviate significantly from the ideal case. This has consequences for the operation of an active feedforward control system which heavily relies on the acquisition of coherent disturbance source information. This work, therefore, evaluates the spatial correlation and coherence of ideal and non-ideal diffuse sound fields and considers the implications on the performance of a feedforward control system. The system under consideration is an aircraft-typical double panel system, equipped with an active sidewall panel (lining), which is realized in a transmission loss facility. Experimental results for different numbers of sound sources in the reverberation room are compared to simulation results of a comparable generic double panel system excited by an ideal diffuse sound field. It is shown that the number of statistically independent noise sources acting on the primary structure of the double panel system depends not only on the type of diffuse sound field but also on the sample lengths of the processed signals. The experimental results show that the number of reference sensors required for a defined control performance exhibits an inverse relationship to control filter length.},

@article{Bodson2005,
abstract = {The paper reviews available methods for the rejection of periodic disturbances. Such disturbances are often encountered in active noise and vibration control, due to rotating machinery. The emphasis of the paper is on feedback control problems where reference sensors are not available. The case where the frequency of the disturbance is known is considered first. Two sets of algorithms are discussed: one based on the internal model principle of feedback control theory, and the second based on adaptive feedforward cancellation. An interesting observation is that algorithms originating from both approaches can be shown to be equivalent under certain conditions. When the frequency of the disturbance is unknown, an intuitive approach consists in combining a method for the rejection of disturbances of known frequency with a frequency estimator. Alternatively, one may seek to develop a stable adaptation mechanism so that the disturbance is cancelled asymptotically. While algorithms can be designed to adapt to plant and disturbance parameters, the most successful approaches use some limited plant information to adapt the magnitude, frequency, and phase parameters of the control signal. Applications are discussed throughout the paper. Copyright {\textcopyright} 2004 John Wiley {\&} Sons, Ltd.},

@article{Filip2006,
abstract = {This paper presents a comparative analysis regarding some adaptive control solutions for the excitation control of a synchronous generator. Two types of adaptive controller are taken into consideration: an adaptive fuzzy controller, respectively an adaptive self-tuning controller. The self-tuning controller is based on a dual action (on control input and also on reference signal). There are used two types of parameters estimators: a recursive least square error parameters estimator and a parameters estimator based on Givens orthogonal transformation. The designed adaptive fuzzy controller includes an adaptation mechanism of the tuning parameters (the singleton output). The algorithm can be also extended to the rest of the singletons (input singletons). Comparative studies are performed regarding the performance of a conventional fuzzy PI or PID controller and the designed adaptive fuzzy PI controller. All simulation studies concern the excitation control of a synchronous generator functioning in active power load regime. A model of a synchronous generator has been developed and used for the simulations. Also a study is made regarding the performances of the proposed adaptive fuzzy controller versus the self-tuning controller. The paper proves that the adaptive control (self-tuning or fuzzy), which is adapting to changing system characteristics, represent solutions that can improve the performances of power systems.},

abstract = {Most of the existing algorithms for parameter estimation of damped sinusoidal signals are based only on the low-rank approximation of prediction matrix and ignore the Hankel property of the prediction matrix. In this correspondence, we propose a modified KT (MKT) algorithm exploiting both rank-deflcient and Hankel properties of the prediction matrix. Computer simulation results demonstrate that compared with the original KT algorithm and the matrix pencil algorithm, the MKT algorithm has lower noise threshold and can estimate the parameters of signal with larger damping factors. {\textcopyright} 1997 IEEE.},

@article{Eriksson1989,
abstract = {Active sound attenuation systems may be described using a system identification framework in which an adaptive filter is used to model the performance of an unknown acoustical plant. An error signal may be obtained from a location following an acoustical summing junction where the undesired noise is combined with the output of a secondary sound source. For the model output to properly converge to a value that will minimize the error signal, it is frequently necessary to determine the transfer function of the secondary sound source and the path to the error signal measurement. Since these transfer functions are unknown and continuously changing in a real system, it is desirable to perform continuous on-line modeling of the output transducer and error path. In this article, the use of an auxiliary random noise generator for this modeling is described. Based on a Galois sequence, this technique is easy to implement, provides continuous on-line modeling, and has minimal effect on the final value of the error signal. {\textcopyright} 1989, Acoustical Society of America.

abstract = {This research investigates a supporting structure with smart struts under a vibratory load. In the case of most rotorcraft, structure-borne noise and vibration transmitted from the gearbox contains multiple spectral elements and higher frequencies, which include gear mesh frequencies and their side bands. In order to manage this issue, significant research have been devoted to active smart struts which have tunable stiffness such that a higher level of attenuation is possible. However, present techniques on active control are restricted mostly to the control of single or multiple sinusoids and thus these are not applicable to manage modulated and multi-spectral signals. Therefore, enhanced control algorithms are required in order to achieve simultaneous attenuation of gear mesh frequencies and their side bands. Proposed algorithms employing two nonlinear methods and one model-based technique are examined in this study. Their performance is verified by comparing with conventional algorithms. Moreover, these algorithms are implemented to exhibit whether they are feasible to narrowband or broadband control through experiments with a single smart strut. Novel methodologies are expected to be applied to several active vibration and noise control practices such as vehicles and other engineering structures. {\textcopyright} 2010 Copyright SPIE - The International Society for Optical Engineering.},
