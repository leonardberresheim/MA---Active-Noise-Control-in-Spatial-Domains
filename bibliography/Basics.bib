abstract = {This chapter discusses the implication and applications of the Fourier transform and power spectrum. The discrete Fourier transform can be used to understand the relationship between a continuous time signal and the sampled version of that signal. This frequency-based analysis shows that the original, unsampled signal can be recovered if the sampling frequency is more than twice the highest frequency component in the unsampled signal. The Fourier series or Fourier transform can be used to construct the power spectrum of a signal. The power spectral curve describes how the signal's power varies with frequency. The power spectrum is useful for random data where phase characteristics have little meaning. By dividing the signal into a number of possibly overlapping segments and averaging the spectrum obtained from each segment, a smoothed power spectrum can be obtained. The resulting frequency curve emphasizes the broadband or general characteristics of a signal's spectrum, but loses some of the fine detail. The concepts of data acquisition and storage, data sampling, and sampling theorem are also discussed. Amplitude slicing quantization, data length truncation, and power spectrum are elaborated. A discussion on spectral averaging, stationarity and time-frequency analysis, and signal bandwidth is also presented in the chapter.},
